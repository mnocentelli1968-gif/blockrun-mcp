**Real-time data for Claude — markets, research, X/Twitter, crypto. No API keys. Pay per call.**

```bash
claude mcp add blockrun -s user -- npx -y @blockrun/mcp@latest
```

Wallet auto-created. Fund with $5 USDC. Ask Claude anything.

## What changes

Before BlockRun, Claude can't answer:

- *"What's the current Polymarket probability that Bitcoin hits $100k this year?"*
- *"Find me the top 5 papers on RAG published in the last 30 days"*
- *"What are people saying about @sama on X right now?"*
- *"What's the 24h volume on the PEPE/ETH pair on Uniswap?"*

After BlockRun, it can. Each query costs fractions of a cent, billed from a local USDC wallet. No subscriptions. No API dashboards. No key rotation.

## Demo

> **User:** What's Polymarket saying about the Fed rate decision next month?

> **Claude:** According to Polymarket, the market currently puts a **73% probability** on the Fed holding rates steady at the May meeting, with 24% on a 25bp cut and 3% on a hike. Volume over the last 24h: $2.1M. The "Hold" contract last traded at $0.73.

> **User:** Find recent papers on speculative decoding and summarize the key approaches

> **Claude:** I found 8 papers from the last 60 days via neural search. The dominant approaches are: (1) draft model selection — smaller models predicting N tokens ahead for the larger model to verify in parallel...

## Install

**Claude Code (recommended)**
```bash
claude mcp add blockrun -s user -- npx -y @blockrun/mcp@latest
```

The `-s user` flag installs globally (available in every project). The `--` separator
ensures `-y` is passed to `npx`, not parsed by `claude mcp add`.

**Claude Desktop** — add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "blockrun": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@blockrun/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Hosted (no install, always latest)**
```bash
claude mcp add blockrun -s user --transport http https://mcp.blockrun.ai/mcp
```

One wallet. All sources. No dashboards.

## Multi-agent budget delegation

Delegate a spending budget to a child agent with `agent_id`. The child is auto-blocked when the budget runs out — useful for autonomous agents that shouldn't run up unbounded costs.

---

## How it works

Pay-per-call via [x402](https://x402.org) micropayments in USDC on Base. Your wallet lives at `~/.blockrun/.session`. Private key never leaves your machine.
