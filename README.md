**Real-time data for Claude — markets, research, X/Twitter, crypto. No API keys. Pay per call.**

```bash
claude mcp add blockrun npx -y @blockrun/mcp@latest
```

Wallet auto-created. Fund with $5 USDC. Ask Claude anything.

## What changes

Before BlockRun, Claude can't answer:

- *"What's the current Polymarket probability that Bitcoin hits $100k this year?"*
- *"Find me the top 5 papers on RAG published in the last 30 days"*
- *"What are people saying about @sama on X right now?"*
- *"What's the 24h volume on the PEPE/ETH pair on Uniswap?"*

After BlockRun, it can. Each query costs fractions of a cent, billed from a local USDC wallet. No subscriptions. No API dashboards. No key rotation.

## Demo

> **User:** What's Polymarket saying about the Fed rate decision next month?

> **User:** Find recent papers on speculative decoding and summarize the key approaches

> **Claude:** I found 8 papers from the last 60 days via neural search. The dominant approaches are: (1) draft model selection — smaller models predicting N tokens ahead for the larger model to verify in parallel...

## Multi-agent budget delegation

Delegate a spending budget to a child agent with `agent_id`. The child is auto-blocked when the budget runs out — useful for autonomous agents that shouldn't run up unbounded costs.

---

## How it works

Pay-per-call via [x402](https://x402.org) micropayments in USDC on Base. Your wallet lives at `~/.blockrun/.session`. Private key never leaves your machine.
